# glints_form_automation
As part of Glints Academy Bootcamp activities, the participants must fill out a form daily. The activity turns out to be a chore, so I decided to automate the process.
This process is not fully automated, a user password (for sudo operation, the Python module `keyboard` requires it) and input is required at the start and end of the automatic filling out process.
